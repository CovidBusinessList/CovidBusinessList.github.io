        <p>Covid-19 has changed the world.  We will never be able to go back to how things were.  Business models have shifted, workers are learning that they can work remotely and be productive, we are already adjusting to a new reality.  Our world view has changed, support systems that we thought would never work?  We have had to implement and MAKE work.  As was said in Jurassic park…Life, finds a way.</p>
        <p>Businesses large and small all around the world are having to re-arrange their business models.   Searching and finding, exploring new ways to survive in an environment we have NEVER seen or experienced before.</p>
        <p>Some companies are doing this responsibly and well, taking care of their workers in ways such as:  allowing remote work, unlimited sick pay in order for them to recover from the virus or to take care of loved ones, raising pay for workers that have to come in to work.</p>
        <p>There are always those that are not so forward thinking not so conscientious.  That look more towards their bottom line without the foresight to see that their people, their employees, health and happiness is paramount to continuing to make a profit.</p>
        <p>This purpose of this page is to highlight responsibly, using credible news sources, those businesses that we feel have gone above and beyond in their efforts to be responsible.  To recognize them as groups and businesses we should support.</p>
        <p>On the flip side we feel it is also our responsibility to shame as well as call out those companies and businesses that are not being responsible.  The goal is to shame them in to adjusting their model to become more socially responsible.</p>
        <p>When this crisis has past, I believe we the people need to work to support the businesses, companies and groups who did the right thing, while limiting the interactions we have with businesses that were irresponsible in regards to their people and society in general.  If all they care about is the bottom line lets show them that being irresponsible has a longer-term negative effect then they thought, as well as showing everyone that being responsible can have a long-term benefit.</p>
        <p>This crisis has shown us all how powerful WE really are.  How much each of us matter.  Let’s keep that going here in the private sector.</p>
